Information
1. The CODE_MANUSCRIPT is the python script with the description of the modeling framework and statistics calculations for obtaining the fluctuation paths and asymmetry coefficients. 
2. The CODE_PAPERnSIALLFIGS is the python script with the description of the modeling framework the code for otaning all the figures in the manuscript and associated supplementary information. This script is for visualizing the results pertaining to this analysis.
3. The Excel Files : AUGINWSA1113.xlsx, AUTTE_GRA.xlsx, CNHA2_WET.xlsx, CNQIA_ENF.xlsx, DKSOR0911.xlsx, ESLJU1113.xlsx, GFGUY0406.xlsx, NLLOO0305.xlsx, RUHA1_GRA.xlsx, USWHS0709.xlsx, and USWKG1214.xlsx are the data extracted from FLUXNET2015 database. Each of these excel files corresponds to a specific site that is used in the analysis. They contain the complete data and variables that have been used for the manuscript entitled ' Time-Asymmetry as Signature of Irreversibility in Land-Atmosphere Net Carbon Exchange'.
4. AC_AVG.xlsx is the excel file that contains the asymmetry average values for all sites and is used for plotting in the CODE_MANUSCRIPT python script.
