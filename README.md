Information
1. The CODE_MANUSCRIPT is the python script with the description of the code used for the analysis and statistics calculations for obtaining the results for the manuscript entitled ' Time-Asymmetry as Signature of Irreversibility in Land-Atmosphere Net Carbon Exchange'.
2. The CODE_PAPERnSIALLFIGS is the python script with the description of the code for obtaning all the figures in the manuscript entitled ' Time-Asymmetry as Signature of Irreversibility in Land-Atmosphere Net Carbon Exchange', and associated supplementary information. This script is for visualizing the results pertaining to this analysis.
3. The Excel Files : AUGINWSA1113.xlsx, AUTTE_GRA.xlsx, CNHA2_WET.xlsx, CNQIA_ENF.xlsx, DKSOR0911.xlsx, ESLJU1113.xlsx, GFGUY0406.xlsx, NLLOO0305.xlsx, RUHA1_GRA.xlsx, USWHS0709.xlsx, and USWKG1214.xlsx are the data extracted from FLUXNET2015 database. Each of these excel files corresponds to a specific site that is used in the analysis. They contain the complete data and variables that have been used for the manuscript entitled ' Time-Asymmetry as Signature of Irreversibility in Land-Atmosphere Net Carbon Exchange'.
4. AC_AVG.xlsx is the excel file that contains the asymmetry average values for all sites and is used for plotting in the CODE_MANUSCRIPT python script.
